This less-than-100-loc project, is a rewrite of https://github.com/billpcs/danooc which I wrote in Aug 2016.

I implemented it in Scala Native, as Scala has startup times not great for this kind of command-line applications.

If you are interested in building `danative` yourself then you can easily follow the instructions at https://www.scala-native.org
